# Dotfiles

These are the configuration files for my Arch Linux machine. I conform to the XDG Base Directory Specification whenever possible, so many of these "dotfiles" do not start with a dot. What's a dotfile without a dot? A dotlessfile?

This Git directory is rooted in my ~/.config directory. Files are tracked using a "blacklist everything first, manually whitelist later" tactic. See .gitignore for details.
